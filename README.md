# MyReads App

Welcome to the 'MyReads' app! It is linked to the Google Books API and enables you to search for books and add them to your 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' or 'Read' shelves. Enjoy :)

### Installation

Fork this repo, then (assuming you have npm) do the following:

```
npm install
```

### Getting Started

Once you've done the above, just type the following and your app will start up:

```
npm start
```

### General Use
On the homepage you will see your three shelves. Every book has a dropdown so you can move them between shelves or remove them completely. On the search page you can search for [these search terms](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md) and then use the dropdown to add them to your shelves. Happy reading!
